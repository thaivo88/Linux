Linux will check for executables in the 'PATH' environment only when the full or relative path to the program is supplied. 
In general, the current directory is not searched unless it is in the 'PATH'.
It is possible to include our current directory within the 'PATH' by adding the directory to the 'PATH' variable.
Command example:
  $ export PATH=$PATH:.
  
This appends the current directory to the value of the 'PATH' variable; each item in the 'PATH' is separated using colon.
Now your 'PATH' has been updated to include the current working, directory and, each time you change directories, the scripts can be executed easily.
Consider creating a subdirectory called 'bin' within your home directory and add the scripts into that folder. 
Adding $HOME/bin to your 'PATH' variable will enable you to find the scripts by name and without the file path.

The command below will only create the directory if it does not already exist:
  $ test -d $HOME/bin || mkdir $HOME/bin
