sacct 
is used to report job or job step accounting information about active or completed jobs.

salloc 
is used to allocate resources for a job in real time. Typically this is used to allocate resources and spawn a shell. 
The shell is then used to execute srun commands to launch parallel tasks.

sattach 
is used to attach standard input, output, and error plus signal capabilities to a currently running job or job step. 
One can attach to and detach from jobs multiple times.

sbatch 
is used to submit a job script for later execution. The script will typically contain one or more srun commands to launch parallel tasks.

sbcast 
is used to transfer a file from local disk to local disk on the nodes allocated to a job. This can be used to effectively use diskless 
compute nodes or provide improved performance relative to a shared file system.

scancel 
is used to cancel a pending or running job or job step. It can also be used to send an arbitrary signal to all processes associated 
with a running job or job step.

scontrol 
is the administrative tool used to view and/or modify Slurm state. Note that many scontrol commands can only be executed as user root.

sinfo 
reports the state of partitions and nodes managed by Slurm. It has a wide variety of filtering, sorting, and formatting options.

smap 
reports state information for jobs, partitions, and nodes managed by Slurm, but graphically displays the information to reflect 
network topology.

squeue 
reports the state of jobs or job steps. It has a wide variety of filtering, sorting, and formatting options. By default, 
it reports the running jobs in priority order and then the pending jobs in priority order.

srun 
is used to submit a job for execution or initiate job steps in real time. srun has a wide variety of options to specify resource 
requirements, including: minimum and maximum node count, processor count, specific nodes to use or not use, and specific node 
characteristics (so much memory, disk space, certain required features, etc.). A job can contain multiple job steps executing 
sequentially or in parallel on independent or shared resources within the job's node allocation.

strigger 
is used to set, get or view event triggers. Event triggers include things such as nodes going down or jobs approaching their time limit.

sview 
is a graphical user interface to get and update state information for jobs, partitions, and nodes managed by Slurm.
