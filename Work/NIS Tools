# NIS Tools
# To work better with the Linux NIS server, there are some useful tools that can help you manage the information in the database.

ypcat: This tool is used to get data from the NIS server by extracting it from NIS map.

ypwhich: gets the name of the Linux NIS server that is responding to your requests.

ypmatch: rather than grabbing the entire map, or you can search by key to get a specific entry.

# if NIS fail to let user access run:
authselect select nis --force

# start ypbind during boot
chkconfig ypbind on
Note: Forwarding request to 'systemctl enable ypbind.service'.
