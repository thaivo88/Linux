#Chown is used to change the owner (or user subject). Its syntax is:
  chown [OWNER] [FILE]
  chown [OWNER:GROUP] [FILE]
#chgrp changes fileâ€™s group. 
  chgrp [GROUP] [FILE]
  
#chmod is used to change the permissions of the three subjects: user;group;others
  chmod [PERMISSION] [FILE]
  chmod 754 
#     permissions: 
#     [r w x] or [4 2 1]
#     chmod: change mode
#     4 stands for "read",
#     2 stands for "write",
#     1 stands for "execute", and
#     0 stands for "no permission."
#    
#     the user can read, write, and execute it;
#     members of your group can read and execute it; 
#     and others may only read it.
#     using above number 754
#     7 = (4: read) + (2: write) + (1: execute)
#     5 = (4: read) + (1: execute)
#     4 = (4: read)

# finding all file owned by one user and changing it to a new users
  find / -uid [oldowner] -exec chown [newuser]:[newgroup] {} +
