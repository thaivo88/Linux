# When we execute ‘usermod‘ command in terminal, the following files are used and affected.

                /etc/passwd – User account information.
                /etc/shadow – Secure account information.
                /etc/group – Group account information.
                /etc/gshadow – Secure group account information.
                /etc/login.defs – Shadow password suite configuration..

  usermod [options] username

# The ‘usermod‘ command is simple to use with lots of options to make changes to an existing user. Let us see how to use usermod command by 
# modifying some existing users in Linux box with the help of following options.

                -c = We can add comment field for the useraccount.
                -d = To modify the directory for any existing user account.
                -e = Using this option we can make the account expiry in specific period.
                -g = Change the primary group for a User.
                -G = To add a supplementary groups.
                -a = To add anyone of the group to a secondary group.
                -l = To change the login name from tecmint to tecmint_admin.
                -L = To lock the user account. This will lock the password so we can’t use the account.
                -m = moving the contents of the home directory from existing home dir to new dir.
                -p = To Use un-encrypted password for the new password. (NOT Secured).
                -s = Create a Specified shell for new accounts.
                -u = Used to Assigned UID for the user account between 0 to 999.
                -U = To unlock the user accounts. This will remove the password lock and allow us to use the user account.

# Adding Information to User Account
# The ‘-c‘ option is used to set a brief comment (information) about the user account. 
# For example, let’s add information on ‘tecmint‘ user, using the following command.
  usermod -c "This is Tecmint" tecmint
# After adding information on user, the same comment can be viewed in /etc/passwd file.
  grep -E --color 'tecmint' /etc/passwd
      tecmint:x:500:500:This is Tecmint:/home/tecmint:/bin/sh
    
# Change User Home Directory
# In the above step we can see that our home directory is under /home/tecmint/, If we need to change it to some other directory 
# we can change it using -d option with usermod command.
# For example, I want to change our home directory to /var/www/, but before changing, let’s check the current home directory of a user, 
# using the following command.
    grep -E --color '/home/tecmint' /etc/passwd
        tecmint:x:500:500:This is Tecmint:/home/tecmint:/bin/sh
# Now, change home directory from /home/tecmint to /var/www/ and confirm the home director after changing.
    usermod -d /var/www/ tecmint
    grep -E --color '/var/www/' /etc/passwd
        tecmint:x:500:500:This is Tecmint:/var/www:/bin/sh
        
# Set User Account Expiry Date
# The option ‘-e‘ is used to set expiry date on a user account with the date format YYYY-MM-DD. 
# Before, setting up an expiry date on a user, let’s first check the current account expiry status using the ‘chage‘ 
# (change user password expiry information) command.
    usermod -e 2019-06-20 [username]

# Change User Primary Group
# To set or change a user primary group, we use option ‘-g‘ with usermod command. Before, changing user primary group, 
# first make sure to check the current group for the user tecmint_test.
    id tecmint_test
        uid=501(tecmint_test) gid=502(tecmint_test) groups=502(tecmint_test)
# Now, set the babin group as a primary group to user tecmint_test and confirm the changes.
    usermod -g babin tecmint_test
    id tecmint_test
        uid=501(tecmint_test) gid=502(babin) groups=502(tecmint_test)
        
# Adding Group to an Existing User
# If you want to add a new group called ‘tecmint_test0‘ to ‘tecmint‘ user, you can use option ‘-G‘ with usermod command as shown below.
    usermod -G tecmint_test0 tecmint
    id tecmint
# Note: Be careful, while adding a new groups to an existing user with ‘-G’ option alone, will remove all existing groups that user 
# belongs. So, always add the ‘-a‘ (append) with ‘-G‘ option to add or append new groups.        

# Adding Supplementary and Primary Group to User
# If you need to add a user to any one of the supplementary group, you can use the options ‘-a‘ and ‘-G‘. 
# For example, here we going to add a user account tecmint_test0 with the wheel user.
    usermod -a -G wheel tecmint_test0
    id tecmint_test0
# So, user tecmint_test0 remains in its primary group and also in secondary group (wheel). 
# This will make my normal user account to execute any root privileged commands in Linux box.
    service httpd restart

# Change User Login Name
# To change any existing user login name, we can use ‘-l‘ (new login) option.
# In the example below, we changing login name tecmint to tecmint_admin. 
# So the username tecmint has been renamed with the new name tecmint_admin.
    usermod -l tecmint_admin tecmint
# Now check for the tecmint user, It will not be present because we have changed it to tecmint_admin.
    id tecmint
# Check for the tecmint_admin account it will be there with same UID and with existing group what we have added before.
    id tecmint_admin

# Lock User Account
# To Lock any system user account, we can use ‘-L‘ (lock) option, After the account is locked we can’t login by using the password and 
# you will see a ! added before the encrypted password in /etc/shadow file, means password disabled.
    usermod -L babin
# Check for the locked account.
    grep -E --color 'babin' cat /etc/shadow

# Unlock User Account
# The ‘-U‘ option is used to unlock any locked user, this will remove the ! before the encrypted password.
    grep -E --color 'babin' /etc/shadow
    usermod -U babin
# Verify the user after unlock.
    grep -E --color 'babin' /etc/shadow

# Move User Home Directory to New location
# Let’s say you’ve a user account as ‘pinky‘ with home directory ‘/home/pinky‘, you want to move to new location say ‘/var/pinky‘. 
# You can use the options ‘-d‘ and ‘-m‘ to move the existing user files from current home directory to a new home directory.
# Check for the account and it’s current home directory.
    grep -E --color 'pinky' /etc/passwd
# Then list the files which is owned by user pinky.
    ls -l /home/pinky/
# Now we have to move the home directory from /home/pinky to /var/pinky.
    usermod -d /var/pinky/ -m pinky
# Next, verify the directory change.
    grep -E --color 'pinky' /etc/passwd
# Check for the files under ‘/home/pinky‘. Here we have moved the files using -m option so there will be no files. The pinky user files will be now under /var/pinky.
    ls -l /home/pinky/
    ls -l /var/pinky/

# Change UID and GID of a User
# We can change UID and GID of a current user. For changing to a New GID we need an existing group. 
# Here already there is an account named as orange with GID of 777.
# Now my jack user account want to be assigned with UID of 666 and GID of Orange (777).
# Check for the current UID and GID before modifying.
    id jack
# Modify the UID and GID.
    usermod -u 666 -g 777 jack
# Check for the changes.
    id jack
