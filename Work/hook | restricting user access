I have created the new hook check_sales_op_queuejob that can be used to restrict the use of the zeus nodes to bskim and pravesh and myself.
So here are the instructions to remove check_sales_op_queuejob and install.
All the commands below are on hpchou-login since it is the PBS server.
#Remove the existing hook first
qmgr -c "d h check_sales_op_queuejob"

#Now we install the restrictive hook
cd /root/pbs/zeus
qmgr -c "create hook check_sales_op_queuejob"
qmgr -c "set hook check_sales_op_queuejob type = site"
qmgr -c "set hook check_sales_op_queuejob event = queuejob"
qmgr -c "import hook check_sales_op_queuejob application/x-python default check_sales_op_queuejob.py"

# you should see no errors with the qmgr commands 
#Then check that the hook is in place.
qmgr -c "l h"

#To test that hte hook is working properly
su - garyf
qsub zeus.sh              #The job should run successful

#Then copy zeus.sh to your home directory and submit the job as yourself.
#The job should fail with this message qsub: Job was rejected because access denied Check motd then contact Thai Vo!

# Should also verify with bskim and pravesh on Monday that the hook works for them as well before live demo.

#To return the hook to the standard one.
#Remove the existing hook first
qmgr -c "d h check_sales_op_queuejob"

#Now we install the standard hook
cd /root/pbs/standard
qmgr -c "create hook check_sales_op_queuejob"
qmgr -c "set hook check_sales_op_queuejob type = site"
qmgr -c "set hook check_sales_op_queuejob event = queuejob"
qmgr -c "import hook check_sales_op_queuejob application/x-python default check_sales_op_queuejob.py"
