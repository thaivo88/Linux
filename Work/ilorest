When loading a clone file taken from an HPE system with HPE Integrated Lights-Out 5 (iLO 5) firmware version 1.40 (or later), warning or error messages may be displayed.

For example, when using the following command:


ilorest iloclone load -f <clone_file.json>

The following warning may be displayed:

Patching:/redfish/v1/Managers/1/EthernetInterfaces/1/

iLOresponse with code [400]: The request included a value for a read-onlyor unknown property.

Patching:/redfish/v1/Managers/1/EthernetInterfaces/2/

iLOresponse with code [400]: The request included a value for a read-onlyor unknown property.

The patch URIs mentioned in the warnings above will not be updated using the iloclone load command.

SCOPE
Any HPE Gen10 system with iLO 5 firmware version 1.40 (or later).

RESOLUTION
The iloclone command has been deprecated in iLOrest 2.40 and will be removed in a later version. To perform the same functionality, use the new command "serverclone" available in iLOrest 2.40 (or later).

Below is an example command line to save and load a configuration using serverclone.

Save:
ilorest serverclone save -f <clone_file.json>

Load:
ilorest serverclone load -f <clone_file.json>
