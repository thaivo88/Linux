Standard Bash Files Descriptors:
  -Stdin: standard input represended by a 0
  -Stdout: standard output represented by a 1
  -Stderr: standard error represented by a 2

  |                            >> output (stdout 1)  |
  |input (stdin 0) >> command =                      |
  |                            >> error (stderr 1)   |
  |__________________________________________________|
  
  Stdout and Stderr send to the same output device but sometime you may want to redirect Stderr into a text file to log all error message.
  
Redirecting Input and Output
  Using > you can redirect the output into a file instead on the screen.
  
Redirection operator 
    >     Creates a new file containing standard output. If file exists it will be overwritten.
    >>    Add standard output to the exisiting file. If file doesn't exists it will create one.
    2>    Creates a new file containing standard error. If file exists it will be overwritten.
    2>>   Add standard error to the exisiting file. If file doesn't exists it will create one.
    &>    Creates a new file containing both standard output and standard error. If file exists it will be overwritten.
    <     Sends the contents of the specified file to be used as standard input.
    <<    Add text on the following lines as standard input.
    <>    Causes the specified file to be used for both standard input and standard output.

    $ echo pwd > path.txt           $ echo pwd 1> path.txt
    $ cat path.txt                  $ cat path.txt
