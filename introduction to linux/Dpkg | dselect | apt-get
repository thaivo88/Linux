Debian-based systems systems often use a pair of somewhat higher-level utilities, apt-get and dselect, to handle package installation and removal.



Using apt-cache

apt-cache : that's intended solely to provide information about the Debian package database.
apt-cache showpkg : Display package information
apt-cache stats : display package statistics; learn how many packages you've installed, how many dependencies are recorded, and various other statistics about the package database.
apt-cache unmet : find unmet dependencies; reports missing libraries or files.
apt-cache depends : displays dependencies; shows all of the specified package's dependencies.
apt-cache pkgnames : displays the names of all the packages installed on the system.
    apt-cachenpkgnames sa : returns only those packages that begin with the specified string.
    


Using apt-get

Debian-based systems include a file, /etc/apt/sources.list, that specifies locations from which important packages can be obtained.
The apt=get utility works by obtaining information about available packages from the sources listed in /etc/apt/sources.list
and then using that information to upgrade or install packages.

              apt-get [options] [command] [package-names]
              
Commands              Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
update              Obtains updated information about packages available from the installation sources listed in /etc/apt/sources.list
upgrade             Upgrades all installed packages to the newest versions available, based on locally stored information about available packages.
dselect-upgrade     Performs any changes in package status (installation, removal, and so on) left undone after running dselect.
dist-upgrade        Similar to upgrade, but performs "smart" conflict resolution to avoid upgrading a package if doing so would break a dependency.
install             Installs a package by package name (not by package filename), obtaining the package from the source that contains the most up-to-date version.
remove              Removes a specified package by package name
source              Retrieves the newest available source package file by package file-name using information about packages listed in /etc/apt/sources.list
check               Checks the package database for consistency and broken package installations.
clean               Performs housekeeping to help clear out information about retrieved files from package database
                    (If you don't use dselect for package management, run this from time to time in order to save disk space.)
autoclean           Similar to clean, but removes information only about packages that can no longer be downloaded.

Using dselect, aptitude, and synaptic

dselect program is a high-level package browser. Using it, you can select packages to install on your system from the APT archives defined
in /etc/apt/sources.list, review the packages that are already installed on your system, uninstall packages, and upgrade packages.
Default dselect isn't installed

aptitude is similar to dselect in a rough way, but aptitude adds menus accessed by pressing Ctrl+T and rearranges some features.
aptitude update : update package list from the APT repositories
aptitude install [package] : install sofware
aptitude install [package]- or aptitude remove [package] : uninstall package
aptitude safe-upgrade : is conservative about removing packages or installing new ones and so may fail
aptitude full-upgrade : is less conservative about these actions, and so it is more likely to complete its tasks. (may break software in the process)
aptitude search : searches the database for packages matching the specified name.
aptitude autoclean : removes already-downloaded packages that are no longer available, and clean removes all downloadeded packages.
aptitude help : a complete list of options



synaptic is a GUI X-based program with similar tools like dselect and aptitude.



You may alter the configuration files for a package; if you do this and find that you've made a mess of things, you may want to revert
to the initial standard configuration.
                  dpkg-reconfigure [package_name]
                  


Debian source packages aren't single files; they're groups of files-the original source tarball, 
a patch file that's used to modify the source code (including a file that controls the building of a debian package), 
and a .dsc file that contains a digital "signature" to help verify the authenticity of the collection.
    -tarball
    -patch file
    -.dsc file is optional

The main configuration file for dpkg is /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg or ~/.dpkg.cfg
APT, the main configuration file you're likely to modify s /etc/apt/sources.list
/etc/apt/apt.conf which controls ATP and dselect options
debian's package tool rely on various files in the /var/lib/dpkg directory tree; these files maintain lists of available packages,
lists of installed packages, and so on. This directory tree is effectively the Debian installed file database.
