                      Filesystem Standard (FSSTND) standardized:
  Standardized the programs that reside in /bin /usr/bin
  Specified that executable files shouldn't reside in /etc
  Removed changeable files from the /usr directory tree, enabling it to be mounted read-only

                      Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
Two important distinction made by the FHS
  Shareable and unsharable files
  Static and variable files
  
Most executable are static files
Users, automated scripts, servers, or the like may change variable files.

    Directories and Their Contents:
  /
Every Linux filesystem traces its roots to a single directory (the root directory or root filesystem). All other directories branch
off this one. Every filesystem is mounted at a mount point within another partition.
  /boot
The /boot directory contains static and unshareable files related to the computer's initial booting. You will find GRUB or LILO 
configuration files along with the other files necessary for the initial boot. It is recommended that you store /boot on its own partition.
  /etc
The /etc dirctory contains unshareable and static system configuration files. These higher-level startup and configuration files control
the various programs and services offered on a system. 
  /bin
This directory contains certain critical executable files, such as ls, cp, and mount. These commands are accessible to all users and
constitute the most important commands that ordinary users might issue. The directory contains static files, and almost never shared-any
potential clients must have their own local /bin directories.
  /sbin
This directory is similar to /bin, but it contains programs that are normally run only by the system administrator-tools like 'fdisk'
and 'e2fsck'. It's static and theoretically shareable, but in practice it makes no sense to share it.
  /lib
This directory is similar to /bin and /sbin, but it contains program libraries. Program libraries consist of code that's shared across
many programs and stored in separate files to save disk space and RAM. The /lib/modules subdirectory contains kernel modules-drivers
that con be loaded and unloaded as required. Like /bin and /sbin, /lib is static and theoretically shareable, although it's not shared in practice.
  /usr
This directory hosts the bulk of a Linux computer's programs. Its contents are shareable and static. Some subdirectories of /usr are 
similar to their namesakes in the root directory (such as /usr/bin and /usr/lib), but they contain programs and libraries that aren't
absolutely critical to the computer's basic functioning.
  /usr/local
This directory contains subdirectories that mirror the organization of /usr, such as /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib. The /usr/local
directory hosts files that a system administrator installs locally-for instance, packages that are compiled on the target computer.
The idea is to have an area that's safe from automatic software upgrades when the OS as a whole is upgraded.
  /usr/share/man
This directory stores the manual pages used by the man command. Any local manual pages are stored in the /usr/local/share/man directory.  
  /usr/X11R6
This directory houses files related to the X Window System (X for short), Linux's GUI environment. Like /usr/local, this directory
contains subdirectories similar to those in /usr, such as /usr/X11R6/bin and /usr/X11R6/lib. Although commonly used several years ago,
most modern distributions have moved the contents of this directory to others, such as /usr/bin
  /opt
This directory is similar to /usr/local in many ways, but it's intended for ready made packages that don't ship with the OS, such
as commercial word processors or games. typically, these programs reside in subdirectories in /opt named after themselves.
The /opt directory is static and shareable
  /home
This directory contains users' data, and it's shareable and variable.  
  /root
This is the home directory for the root user; variable directory isn't really shareable.
  /var
This directory contains transient files of various types-system log files, print spool files, mail and new files, and so on. Therefore,
the directory's contents are variable. Some subdirectories are shareable, but others are not.
  /tmp
Many programs need to create temporary (hence variable) files, and the usual place to do so is in /tmp. Most distributions include 
routines that clean out this directory periodically and sometimes wipe the directory clean at bootup. The /tmp directory is seldom shared.
A similar directory exists as part of the /var directory tree /var/tmp
  /mnt
Linux mounts removable-media devices within its normal directory structure, and /mnt is provided for this purpose.  
  /media
It's like /mnt, but it should contain subdirectories for specific media types, such as /media/dvd  
  /dev
Because Linux treats most hardware devices as if they were files, the OS must have a location in its filesystem where these device files
reside. The /dev directory is that place. The Linux kernel supports a device filesystem that enables /dev to be an automatically created
virtual filesystem-the kernel and support tools create /dev entries on the fly to accommodate the needs of specific drivers.
  /proc
This is an unusual directory because it doesn't correspond to a regular directory or partition. Instead, it's a virtual filesystem that's
created dynamically by Linux to provide access to certain types of hardware information that aren't accessible via /dev.

Directories should NOT be on their own partitions:
/bin
/dev
/etc
/lib
/sbin
