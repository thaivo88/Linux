#To view the default target, type the command below.

#  Linux are config to boot into a graphical environment called runlevel5
#    Runlevel3 : text base environment CLI
#    Runlevel5 : Graphical environment GUi
#        To switch environment use the command:
            init[runlevel_number]
#            example: init 3
#            switches from GUI to CLI
  
#  Command to shut system down
#      init 0 : switch the system to runlevel0 ; which halts the system
#      init 6 : switch to runlevel6 ; reboot the system
#      halt : shutdown the system
#      reboot : reboot the system
#      shutdown : shutdown the system
#          shutdown +m -h|-r message
#            +m option specifies the amount of time (in minutes) before shutting down or replace it with a time hh:mm
#            -h|-r option = halt | reboot
