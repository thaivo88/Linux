                      Disk Use
df and du programs, which summarize disk use on a partition-by-partition and directory-by-directory basis.                      

                      df

        Monitoring Disk Use by Partition
You can type the command name to see a summary of disk space used on all of the system's partition
      df [options] [files]

Options:      
    Include All Filesystems:
The -a or --all option includes pseudo-filesystems with a size of 0 in the output.
    Use Scaled Units
The -h or --human-readable option causes df to scale and label its units. example 100KiB, 350MiB, 150G
The -H and --si option have a similar effect, but they use power of 10 units rather than power of 2.
The -k (--kilobyets) and -m (--megabytes) options force output in their respective units.
  Summarize Inodes:
Report on available and used inodes by passing the -i or --inodes option.
  Local filesystem only:
The -l or --local option causes 'df' to omit network filesystems.
  Display Filesystem Type:
The -T or --print-type option adds the filesystem type to the information 'df' displays.
  Limit by filesystem type:
The -t [fstype] or --type=fstype option displays only information about filesystems of the specified type.
The -x [fstype] or --exclude-type=fstype option has the opposite effect; it excludes filesystems of the specified type from the report.

                    du
                    
You can use 'du' to find the disk usage
      du [options] [directories]
This command searches directories that you specify and reports how much disk space each is consuming. This search is recursive,
so you can learn how much space the directory and all its subdirectories consume.

Options:
  Summarize file and directories:
Passing the -a or --all option causes 'du' to report on individual files as well.
  Compute a Grand Total:
-c or --total option causes 'du' to add a grand total to the end of its output.
  Use Scaled Units:
-h or --human-readable option causes 'du' to scale and label its units.
-H and --si option have a similar effect, but they use power of 10 units rather than power of 2 units.
-k --kilobytes and -m --megabytes options force output in their respective units.
  Count hard links:
'du' counts files that appear multiple times as hard links only once.
-l or --count-links option counts hard links aswell
  Limit Depth:
--max-depth=n option limits the report on n level. The subdirectories' contents are counted even if they aren't reported.
  Summarize:
If you don't want a line of output for each subdirectory in the tree, pass the -s or --summarize option.
This option is equivalent to --max=depth=0
  Limit to one filesystem:
-x or --one-file-system option limits the report to the current filesystem.



                    Mount/umount
      mount [-alrsvw] [-t fstype] [-o options] [device] [mountpoint]

Features:
  Mount all filesystems:
The -a parameter causes mount to mount all of the filesystems listed in the /etc/fstab file.  
  Mount read-only:
The -r parameter causes Linux to mount the filesystem read-only  
  Show verbose output:
The -v produces verbose output the program provides comments on operations as they occur.  
  Mount Read/Write:
The -w parameter causes Linux to attempt to mount the filesystem for both read and write operations.
The -o rw option has the same effect
  Specify the filesystem type:
Use the -t [fstype] parameter to specify the file system type.
  Mount by label or UUID:
Instead of the device name, you can use the -L [label] or -U [UUID] options to tell mount to mount the filesystemm with the specified
label or UUID.
  Additiional Option:
