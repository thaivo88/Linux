Understanding Email

Several protocols exist to manage email. The most common of these is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), which is designed as
a 'push' mail protocol, meaning that the sending system initiates the transfer. This design is good for sending data, so SMTP
is used through most of a mail delivery system. The final stage, though, often employs a 'pull' mail protocol, such as the 
Post Office Protocol (POP) or the Internet Massage Acces Protocol (IMAP). With these protocols, the receiving system initiates the 
transfer. This is useful when the receiving system is an end user's workstation, which may not be powered on at all times or able to
receive incoming connections.

SMTP was designed to enable a message to be relayed through an arbitrary number of computers. For instance, an end user may compose a
message, which is sent to the local SMTP server. SMTP servers are also known as Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs). The MTA looks up a recipient
system and sends the message to that computer. This system may use its own internal routing table to redirect the message to another 
local computer from which the message may be read, either directly or via a POP or IMAP server. These servers are also known as 
Mail User Agents (MUAs).

The basic steps for the creation, transfer, and delivery of emails are as follows:
1.  A user creates an email message using and email client, called a Mail User Agent (MUA).
2.  The MUA gives the email to a Mail Submission Agent (MSA).
3.  The MSA then hands off the email to a Mail Transfer Agent (MTA).
4.  The MTA is responsible for transferring the email to the Mail Delivery Agent (MDA).
5.  The Mail Delivery Agent handles delivering the email to the Mail User Agent (MUA)
6.  The recipient user then reads the email message via the MUA.

MTA can function as both a server (receiving mail rom other systems) and a client (sending mail to other systems). Therefore, you must
deal with both sides of the configuration equation.

Email Software

Four email MTA servers are popular on linux:
1:  Sendmail
    It's very powerful, but it can be hard to configure because its configuration file formats are rather difficult.
2:  Postfix
    Designed as a modular. Postfix uses multiple programs, each of which handles its own specific small task.
3:  Exim
    Huge server like sendmail, it has a much simpler configuration file format and so is easier to configure.
4:  Qmail
    Is a modular server with security as a major design goal.
    
You can also look for executable files for each email MTA server in /usr/bin or /usr/sbin. Be aware that many Linux email servers
include a program called 'sendmail'. This program is not the sendmail program discussed earlier, but instead an interface to other 
email server.



Working with email

Tasks involve sending and receiving mail using the 'mail' utility, email queue management, configuring aliases, and forwarding email.
'mail' command-line based program
This tool is a very basic command-line email utility. It has the advantage of being usable from a script. Therefore, you can write
a script to handle some email task automatically, and perhaps even run that script automatically.
The 'mail' program is intended to be used on the command-line to send or receive messages. 

The basic syntax for 'mail', including its most useful options for sending email, is as follows:
  mail [-v] [-s subject] [-c cc-address] [-b bcc-address] to-address
The basic syntax for receiving email as follows:
  mail [-v] [-f [name] | -u user]
  
Unlike most email readers, the 'mail' command supports reading only the local email queue, not email stored on remote servers and read
via the POP or IMAP protocols.

mail options:

  Use Verbose Operation:  The -v option produces more verbose output.
  Specify a Subject Line: The -s subject option enables you to specify a subject line.
  Set a Carbon Copy Address:  You can send a message to multiple people by using the -c and -b option.
  Set the Recipient's Address:  The main recipient's email address is required and terminates the 'mail' command's 
line for an outgoing email.
  Read Email: To read your email, optionally pass the -f option to the program followed by the name of the mail spool file. 
Alternatively, you can use the -u option to read the mail of the specified user.
    
After you type the 'mail' command, the program waits for input via standard input, but there's no prompt. You signal the end of the 
message by pressing Ctrl+D. This example shows a simple one-line message. After you press Ctrl+D, the progmam displays EOT, which
stands for End of Transmission, and the message is on the way.

To use mail in script, you can use input redirection to pass it the contents of a file to be mailed:
 mail -s ["subject"] < [file] [users]
 mail -s "Automated Alert!" < /tmp/alert.txt john
This line, if included in a script, sends the contents of the /tmp/alert.txt file to the user john with the "Automated Alert!" subject.

You can use the 'mail' to read incoming email too, but only if it's stored on a local linux mail spool. You'll normally use 'mail'
interactively. Type 'mail', and you'll see the contents of your mail spool. Each message has a summary line that lists the sender, date,
and subject, among other things:
 0046 sally@luna.edu Sun Jan 13 18:27 116/4262 Priorities
This is mesaage number 46, it's from sally@luna.edu, it arrived on Jan 13 at 18:27, it has 116 lines and 4262 bytes (including headers),
and its subject is Priorities.

To read a message, type its number, you can then delete the message by typing 'd' or reply to it by typing 'r'
The mail server holds incoming messages for each user, typically in a file in the /var/spool/mail/ directory. Some email servers store
incoming mail in user's home directories, such as ~/maildir. This incoming mail file or directory is referred to as the user's mail
spool.

Checking Email Queue

As email server manages a queue of email messages that it must deliever. The email server sends email messages to another computer
or stores them in local users' mail spools. Various problems can lead to a temporary or permanent inability to deliver messages.
When a problem seems to be temporary, such as a network routing failure, the email server must store the message and try to deliever
it again later.Thus, a linux server's email queue may contain undelivered messages. Knowing how to identify these messages and manage 
the queue can help you keep your email subsystem working smoothly.

the 'mailq' program is the main tool to help in email queue management. This program was originally part of the sendmail package, but
Postfix, Exim, qmail, and other linux. MTA servers have all implemented compatible commands.
