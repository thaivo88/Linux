It is responsible for interfacing all of your applications that are running in “user mode” down to the physical hardware, 
and allowing processes, known as servers, to get information from each other using inter-process communication (IPC).

Packages:
The most basic information that package systems maintain is information about software packages-that is, collections of files that are
installed on the computer. Packages are usually distributed as single files that are similar to tarballs 
(archives created with the tar utility and usually compressed with gzip or bzip2) or zip files.
