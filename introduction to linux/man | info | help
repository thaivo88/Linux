man command is short for manual. if you want to learn more about the shell commands you would type man [command]
to quit press Q
default the manual is displayed using less pager
ues the -P option to use more pager
use the -K option if you can't remember the exact name of the command: man -k [keyword/command]
if you get no resuts from a man utility keyword search, its most likely due to a missing whatis database.
The whatis database contains a short description of each man page.
to create it or update it, type makewhatis at the prompt.

man is organized into several sections
1     exectable programs and shell commands
2     system calls provided by the kernel
3     library calls provided by program libraries
4     device files (usually stored in /dev)
5     file formats
6     games
7     miscellaneous (macro packages, coventions, and so on)
8     system administration commands (programs run mostly or exclusively)
9     kernal routines

some commands are in multiple sections; man returns the entry in the lowest-numbered section
man [number of section] [command] ; man 5 passwd (return file formats manual instead of exectable programs; passwd is listed in section 1 and 5)

some programs are moving away from man pages to info pages
info pagges use hypertext format (info pages is the same as that for man pages)
info [command]

help is another reference tool for built-in commands
help [command]
