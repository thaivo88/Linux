vi text editor

Three modes in which it operates:
  1:  Command Mode or Normal Mode: This mode accepts commands, which are usually entered as single letters.
        i or a  insert mode
        o opens a line below the current one
  2:  Ex Mode or Colon command: To manipulate file. You enter ex mode from command mode by typing a colon (:)
  3:  Insert Mode or Edit mode: Once in insert mode you can edit and modify the file. Esc key will exit insert mode and enter command mode.
  
The tildes (~) down the left side of the display indicate the end of the file.

Command mode
  o : Open Text, inserts a new line below the current one and enters insert mode.
  [n]yy : Yank [n] line of text. Yank is like copy-you copy the text to a buffer from which you can later paste it back into the file.
use the yy (do not press the Enter key) command preceded by the number of lines you want to yank.
  dd : works like yy, but it deletes the lines as well as copying them to a buffer.
  dw : delete the next word
  p : (do not press the Enter key) paste the contents of the buffer starting on the line after the cursor.
  R : enter insert mode so that it's configured for text replacement rather than insertion.
    ~ : Change Case, you can use the tilde (~) key in command mode to change the case. Position the cursor on the first character you want
to change, and press ~ repeatedly until the task is done.
  u : undo in command mode
  /[keywords] or ?[keywords] : to search the file use / or ? to search backwards 
  c : Change Text within the command mode
  cw : change word
  cc : change entire line
  G : brings you to a line that you specify
  H : "home" the cursor like the home button
  L : brings the cursor to the bottom line of the screen
  :%s/[original]/[replacement]/g : to replaec all occurrences of one string with another. Change % to a starting line number, comma, 
and ending line number to perform this change on a small range of lines.
  ZZ : write and quit
