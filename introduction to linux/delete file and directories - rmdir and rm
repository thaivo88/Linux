rm and rmdir
remove and remove directories syntax

rmdir can only be used to remove an empty directory. It won't work for non-empty directories.
rm removes both files and non-empty directories (user -r option to remove directory)

An even faster solution is rm -rf, which removes recursively and forcefully all files in a directory and the directory itself.

   Options:
Recursion:
  Remove recursive directory and all its file and subdirectory
Force Overwrite:  -f or --force
  Forces the system to overwrite any existing files without prompting.
Use Interactive Mode: -i or --interactive
  Ask you before overwriting any existing files
Perform and Update copy:  -u or --update
  Tell move the file only if the original is newer than the target or if the target doesn't exist.
