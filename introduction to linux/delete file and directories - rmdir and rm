rm and rmdir
remove and remove directories syntax

rmdir can only be used to remove an empty directory. It won't work for non-empty directories.
rm removes both files and non-empty directories

An even faster solution is rm -rf, which removes recursively and forcefully all files in a directory and the directory itself.
