rm and rmdir
remove and remove directories syntax

   rm [options] [files]
   rmdir [options] [directory]

rmdir can only be used to remove an empty directory. It won't work for non-empty directories.
rm removes both files and non-empty directories (user -r option to remove directory)

An even faster solution is rm -rf, which removes recursively and forcefully all files in a directory and the directory itself.

   Options:
Recursion:
  Remove recursive directory and all its file and subdirectory
Force Overwrite:  -f or --force
  Forces the system to overwrite any existing files without prompting.
Use Interactive Mode: -i or --interactive
  Ask you before overwriting any existing files
Perform and Update copy:  -u or --update
  Tell move the file only if the original is newer than the target or if the target doesn't exist.

rmdir

Ignore Failure on Non-empty Directories: --ignore-fail-on-non-empty
   Still doesn't delete the directory, but it doesn't return an error
Delete Tree: -p or --parents
   Causes rmdir to delete an entire directory tree.
   example:
      rmdir -p /home/voth/iso
   will delete all of /iso file and directory then /voth then /home
