Reformatting paragraphs with fmt
  fmt attempts to clean up paragraphs, which it assumes are delimited by two or more blank lines or by changes in indentation.
  New paragraph formatting defaults to paragraphs that are no more than 75 characters wide.
      -w [width] or --width=[width] : set the line length to with characters.
      
Numbering lines with nl
  numbering the lines of a file; more complex line numbering than cat -n
    -b [style] or --body-numbering=[style] : set the numbering style for the bulk of the lines
    style is a style format code
  If the text is formatted for printing and has headers or footers, you can set the style for the elements with:  
    -h [style] or --header-number=[style] 
    -f [style] or --footer-number=[style] 
        style code:
          t   default behavior is to number lines that aren't empty
          a   causes all lines to be numbered, including empty lines
          n   causes all line numbers to be omitted, which may be desirable for headers or footers
          pREGEXP   causes only lines that match the specified regular expression (REGEXP) to be numbered.
    -d=[code] or --section-delimiter=[code] : Numbering schemes reset the line numbers for each page, this option help identify a new page.
    code is a code for the character that identifies the new page.
    -p or --no-renumber : nl begins numbering each new page with line 1; it doesn't reset the line number with a new page.
    -n [format] or --number-format=[format] : specify the numbering format
      format 
      default left justified with leading zeros
      ln left justified, no leading zeros
      rn right justified, no leading zeros
      rz right justified with leading zeros
      
Preparing a file for printing with pr
Printing a plain-text file, you may want to prepare it with headers, footers. page breaks, and so on.
By default, pr creates output that includes the original text with headers, which lists the current date and time, 
the original filename, and the page number.
    Generate multicolumn output: creates output with numcols columns. 
    pr doesn't reformat text; if lines are too long, they're truncated or run over into multiple columsn.
      -numcols or --columns=numcols
    Generate double-spaced output: output double spacing instead of single spaced
      -d or --double-space
    Use form feeds
    Ordinarily, pr separates pages by using a fixed number of blank lines. 
    If the printer doesn't use the same number of lines that pr expects, use form feed chatacter between pages.
      -F or -f or --form-feed
    Set page length: sets the length of the page in lines.
      -l [lines] or --length=[lines]
    Set the header text :    sets the text to be displayed in the header, replacing the filename.
    Multi-word string; enclose it in quotes
      -h [text] or --header=[text]
      -t 0r --omit header : omits the header entirely
    Set left margin and page width : margin size is added to the page width, which default to 72 characters
      -o [chars] or --indent=[chars] : sets the left margin to [chars] characters.    
      -w [chars] or width [chars]
