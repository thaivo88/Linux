Reformatting paragraphs with fmt
  fmt attempts to clean up paragraphs, which it assumes are delimited by two or more blank lines or by changes in indentation.
  New paragraph formatting defaults to paragraphs that are no more than 75 characters wide.

Numbering lines with nl
  numbering the lines of a file; more complex line numbering than cat -n
    -b [style] or --body-numbering=[style] : set the numbering style for the bulk of the lines
    style is a style format code
  If the text is formatted for printing and has headers or footers, you can set the style for the elements with:  
    -h [style] or --header-number=[style] 
    -f [style] or --footer-number=[style] 
        style code:
          t   default behavior is to number lines that aren't empty
          a   causes all lines to be numbered, including empty lines
          n   causes all line numbers to be omitted, which may be desirable for headers or footers
          pREGEXP   causes only lines that match the specified regular expression (REGEXP) to be numbered.
    -d=[code] or --section-delimiter=[code] : Numbering schemes reset the line numbers for each page, this option help identify a new page.
    code is a code for the character that identifies the new page.
    -p or --no-renumber : nl begins numbering each new page with line 1; it doesn't reset the line number with a new page.
    -n [format] or --number-format=[format] : specify the numbering format
      format 
      default left justified with leading zeros
      ln left justified, no leading zeros
      rn right justified, no leading zeros
