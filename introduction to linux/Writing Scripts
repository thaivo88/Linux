A shell script's first line identifies the shell that should be used to run the script.
  #!/bin/bash
The first two characters are a special code that tells the Linux kernel that this is a script.
This line is sometimes called the shebang, hashbang, hashpling, or pound bang line.
After the first line, shell scripting languages consider a hash mark (#) as a comment character. The script utility ignores characters
on a script line after the hash mark.

              Different way to run a shell script
              
When you're done writing the shell script, you can modify it so that it's executable. You do this with the chmod command, you use the
+x option to add execute permissions.
  chmod u+x my_script.sh
  
Typing the script's name, preceded by bash
This method does not require execution permission to run the script. However, it does create a subshell.
  chmod u+x my_script.sh
  bash my_script.sh
  
Typing the script's name, preceded by ./
This method does require execution permission. It also creates a subshell to run the script.
  chmod u+x my_script.sh
  ./my_script.sh
  
Just typing in the script's full path and name is needed.
This method also requires the execution permission to be set on the script. It creates a subshell to run the script as well
  chmod u+x my_script.sh
  /directory-location/my_script.sh
  
Just typing in the script's name requires the shell script to be moved to a directory on your path, such as /usr/local/bin
This is the preferred method for scripts that will be used by others.
This method requires the appropriate execution permission to be set. Since it will be used by all system users, the chmod a+x command
is used to grant execute permission to everyone. Note that the $PATH environment variable contains the directory /usr/local/bin
where the my-script.sh file was moved. Also note that this method creates a subshell when the script is run.
  mv my_script.sh /usr/local/bin/
  my_script.sh
  
Typing the script's name, preceded by sh, is nearly identical to preceding it with the bash command.
This method does not require execution permission to run the script, and it creates a subshell to run the script.
  sh my_script.sh == bash my_script.sh
  
Typing the keyword source before the script name tells the bash shell to use a method type called sourcing. 
When you source a script, a subshell is not created to run the script. This method also does not require execute permissions.
  source my_script.sh
  
Typing a dot (.) and then a space before the script name also tells the bash shell to use the sourcing method type.
This method also does not create a subshell. This method does not need execute permission permission.
  . my_script.sh == source my_script.sh
  
The last method for executing script uses the exec command. This method does need execute permission set on the file.
exec command will exit the current bash shell when it is doen running the script.
Notice that the ./ execution method has to be placed before the script's name. This is because exec is not truly a script execution
method. It does not create a subshell but instead replaces the current shell with an executable image environment to run the script.
A script execution method must be included in the exec command line in order to run a script. Cannot source a script using exec,
however. Only execution methods that create a subshell will work with the exec command.
  exec ./my_script.sh
      exec source my_script.sh == not found
      exec . my_script.sh == not found
