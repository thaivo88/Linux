Displaying files in Octal with od
          od (octal dump)
some files aren't easily displayed in ASCII (graphics, audio, and non-ASCII files); it looks gibberish!
od display files in an octal (base 8) format by default.
the first field on each line (you can look at it as like the first column) as an index, 
the remaining number on each line represent the bytes in the file.
