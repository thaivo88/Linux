Displaying files in Octal with od
          od (octal dump)
some files aren't easily displayed in ASCII (graphics, audio, and non-ASCII files); it looks gibberish!
od display files in an octal (base 8) format by default.
the first field on each line (you can look at it as like the first column) as an index, 
the remaining number on each line represent the bytes in the file.

Sorting files with sort
    -f or --ignore-case : ingnore case
    -M or --month-sort : sort by three-letter month abbreviation example (JAN)
    -n or --numeric-sort : sort b number
    -r or --reverse : sorts in reverse order
    -k [field] or --key=[field] : sort by field column; to use more than one field, separated the fields by commas
          example: sort -k 3 listing.txt
          
Breaking a file into pieces with split
          -b [size] or --bytes=size : breaks the input file into pieces of size bytes.
                    This option can have undesirable consequence of splitting the file mid-lines.
          -C=[size] or --line-bytes=[size] : split by bytes in line sizeed chunks
