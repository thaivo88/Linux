    Options:

  Forces the system to overwrite any existing files without prompting.
Use Interactive Mode: -i or --interactive
  Ask you before overwriting any existing files
Preserve Ownership and Permissions: -p or --preserve
  Preserves ownership and permission of the copied file.
Perform a Rcursive copy:  -R or --recursive
  Copy the entire directory including its subdirectories.
  -r also performs a recursive copy, its behavior with files other than ordinary files and directories is unspecified.
Perform an Archive copy:  -a or archive
  Simlar to -R but it also preserves ownership and copies links as is.
  The -R option copies the files to which symbolic links points rather than the symbolic links themselves.
Perform and Update copy:  -u or --update
  Tell copy the file only if the original is newer than the target or if the target doesn't exist.
