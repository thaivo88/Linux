    Configuring Printing

Applications submit print jobs as PostScript documents. Because most Linux systems aren't connected directly to true PostScript printers,
a program called Ghostscript converts the print job into a form that the system's printer can actually handle. The print queue, which is
managed by software known as the Common Unix Printing System (CUPS), then sends the job to the printer.
