          Linux, the main GUI is known as the X Window System or X for short.

Several implementations of X are available:
  XFree86 : The dominant X server in Linux until 2004 was XFree86. This open-source server supports a wide array of video cards and
input devices.  A significant changes occurred between version 3.3.6 and the 4.x series.
  X.org-X11 : Most Linux distributions shifted from XFree86 to X.org-Xll because of licensing changes to XFree86. Because X.org-X11
is based on XFree86, the two are virtually identical in most important respects. One significant difference is the name of the 
configuration file and another is the default location for fonts.
  Accelerated-X : The commercial Accelerated-X sercer from Xi Graphics is an alternative to the open-source XFree and X11. 
  


          x configuration utilities
        
The X server itself includes the capacity to query the hardware and produce a configuration file. 
To do this, type:
    XFree86 -configure      # for XFree86
    Xorg -configure         # for X.org-X11
The configuration file should be located at:
    /root/XF86Config.new    # for XFree86
    /root/xorg.config.new   # for X.org-X11
    
Many modern distributions ship with their own custom X configuration tools. 
Display Settings Tool - accessible from the default desktop menu or by typing:
    system-config-display
    	
          
    
          X configuration file format

X.org-X11
This server's configuration file is called xorg.conf and it's usually stored in /etc/X11
    (Many modern X.org-X11 configurations omit the X configuration file entirely, instead relying on runtime auto-detection of hardware.
    This often works fine, but if X doesn't work or if some of its features are set incorrectly, you may need to generate an xorg.conf
    file by typing Xorg-configure when X is not running and edit the file manually.)
    
XFree86 4.x 
This server's configuration file is called XF86Config-4 or XF86Config and is found in /etc/X11 or /etc

XFree86 3.3.6 and earlier
The X configuration file's name is XF86Config and the file is located in /etc/X11 or /etc

All three of these classes of X server use configuration files that are broken down into multiline sections, one section 
for each major feature. These sections begin with a line consisting of the keyword 'Section' and the section name in quotes and end
with the keywork 'EndSection:'

############## X Config file ##############
Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier  "Keyboard0"
    Driver      "kbd"
    Option      "XkbModel" "pc105"
    Option      "XkbLayout" "us"
    Option      "AutoRepeat" "500 200"
EndSection
################ End ################

Some Exception to X configuration file between version
The 'Option' key isn't used in XFree86 3.3.6 and earlier. Instead, the option name appears without quotes as the first word on the line.
XFree86 3.3.6 and earlier don't use this 'ServerLayout' section.
XFree86 3.3.6 and earlier lack the 'Identifier' and 'Driver' line.

Once the X session is shut down, you can log in using a text-mode login prompt and tweak your X settings manually. 
To start the X server again:
          startx
If you get the desired results, quit from X to restore the system to its normal X login screen:
          telinit 5
or                
          /etc/init.d/xdm start
          
Kill the X server:  Ctrl+Alt+Backspace or use the kill command



          X Configuration Options
The 'Module' section controls the loading of X server modules-drivers for specific features or hardware.

########## X server Modules ###########
Section "Module"
          Load "dbe"
          Load "extmod"
          Load "fbdevhw"
          Load "glx"
          Load "record"
          Load "freetype"
          Load "type1"
          Load "dri"
EndSection
################ End ################

For the most part, if an X configuration works, you shouldn't try to adjust the 'Module' section.

########## Input Device ###########
Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier  "Keyboard0"
    Driver      "kbd"
    Option      "XkbModel" "pc105"
    Option      "XkbLayout" "us"
    Option      "AutoRepeat" "500 200"
EndSection
################ End ################

The 'Identifier' line provides a label that's used by another section (ServerLayout)
The 'Driver' line tells X what driver to use to access the keyboard.
The 'kbd' and 'keyboard' drivers are keyboard-specific drivers.
The 'evdev' driver, by contrast, is a generic input device driver.
The 'Option' lines set various options that adjust keyboard features, such as the model, the layout, and the repeat rate.
The time until the first repeat and the time between subsequent repeats, both expressed in milliseconds (ms).

########## Input Device ###########
Section "InputDevice"
    Identifier  "Keyboard0"
    Driver      "kbd"
    Option      "XkbModel" "pc105"
    Option      "XkbLayout" "us"
    Option      "AutoRepeat" "500 200"
EndSection
################ End ################

The 'Driver' line identifies the driver to use: 'mouse'. (Many modern systems use 'evdev' for the mouse.)
The 'Option' lines set mouse control options.
The most important of these are 'Device' and 'Protocol'.
The 'Device' line tells X what Linux device file to read to access the mouse.
The 'Protocol' option tells X what signals to expect from the mouse for various movements and button presses.
The 'Auto' protocol causes X to try to guess the mouse's protocol.
If it doesn't work, you can try more specific protocols, such as 'IMPS/2' and 'ExploreerPS/2'.
(Mouses use the PS/2 protocol even if they don't use the PS/2 port; as PS/2 is a hardware and software: protocol)
'Emulate3Buttons' option tells X wheather to treat a 'chord' (simultaneous press) of both buttons on a two button mouse as if were a
middle-button press.
This option is usually disabled on three-button mice and scroll mice (the scroll wheel does double duty as a middle mouse button)
The 'ZAxisMapping' option in the preceding example maps the scroll wheel actions to the fourth and fifth buttons, because X must
treat scroll wheels as if they were buttons. When you scroll up or down, these "button" presses are generated.
Software can detect this and take appropriate actions. Button 4 scroll up, Button 5 scrool down



                    Setting the Monitor
Some of the trickiest aspects of X configuration relate to the monitor options.

########## Input Device ###########
Section "Monitor"
    Identifier      "Monitor0"
    ModelName       "AOC e2343FK"
    HorizSync       30.0 - 83.0
    VertRefresh     55.0 - 75.0
    # My custom     1920x1080 mode
    Modeline        "1920x1080" 138.50 1920 1968 2000 2080 1080 1083 1088 1111
EndSection
################ End ################

The 'Identifier' option can be just about anything you like. Likewise, the 'ModelName' option can be anything you like; it's used mainly
for your own edification when reviewing the configuration file.
'HorizSync' and 'VertRefresh' lines, which are extremely critical. They define the range of horizontal and vertical refresh rates
that the monitor can accept, in kilohertz (kHz) and hertz (Hz). Together, these values determine the monitor's maximum resolution and
refresh rate.
'HorizSync' item alone doesn't determine the maximum horizontal refresh rate. Rather, this value, the 'VertRefresh' value, and the
resolution determine the monitor's maximum refresh rate.
To settle on a resolution, X looks through a series of 'mode lines', which are specified via the 'Modeline' option. Computing mode
lines is tricky, so we don't recommend that you try it unless you're skilled in such matters. The mode lines define combinations of
horizontal and vertical timing that can produce a given resolution and refresh rate.

Some mode lines represent video modes that are outside the horizontal or vertical sync ranges of a monitor. X can compute these cases
and discard the video modes that a monitor can't support. If asked to produce a given reolution, X searches all of the mode lines
that accomplish the job, discards those that the monitor can't handle, and uses the remaining mode line that creates the highest refresh
rate at that resolutioin. (If no mode line supports the requested resolution, X drops down to another specified resolution.)

XFree86 4.x and X.org-X11 support a feature known as 'Data Display Channel' (DDC). This is a protocol that enables monitors to communicate 
their maximum horizontal and vertical refresh rate and appropriate mode lines to the computer. You may need to create a Modeline option
if this feature fails, though.



                    Setting the Video Card
Your monitor is usually the most important factor in determining your maximum refresh rate at any given resolution. An incorrect
configuration of the video card is likely to result in an inability to start X.

Sometimes X, and particularly modern versions of X.org-X11, can pick the optimum video driver automatically.
          Driver "nv"
This line sets the name of the driver. The drivers reside in the /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/drivers/ or /usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/ directory.
Most of the drivers' filenames en in [name]_drv.o, and if you remove this portion, you're left with the driver name.

If you type Xorg -configure to create an initial configuration, the resulting file is likely to include multiple 'Device' sections,
each for a different driver. Some of these, such as 'fbdev' and 'vesa', are generic drivers that work. Today, you're most likely
to use the 'nv' or 'nouveau' drivers for nvidia, 'radeon' driver for AMD/ATI cards, and 'intel' driver for intel cards.

############################################

The 'Identifier' line provides a name that's used in the subsequent 'Screen' section to identify this particular 'Device' section.
The 'VendorName' and 'BoardName' lines provide information that's useful mainly to people reading the file.
The 'VideoRam' line is unnecessary with most boards because the driver can detect the amount of RAM installed in the card.
With some devices, however, you may need to specify the amount of RAM installed in the card in kilobytes.

          Setting the resolution and color depth.:
The 'Screen' section tells X about the combination of monitors and video cards that you're using. XFree86 4.x and X.org-X11 
support multiple video cards and monitors on one system.

############################################

The 'Device' and 'Monitor' lines refer to the 'Identifier' lines in your 'Device' and 'Monitor' sections, respectively. The 'Screen'
section includes one or more 'Display' subsections, which define the video modes that X may use.
To choose between the 'Display' subsections, you include a 'DefaultDepth' line. In this example, X uses the 24-bit display if possible,
unless it's overridden by other options when starting X.
Graphical video modes require a certian amount of RAM on the video card. 
Integrated video chip, portion of system RAM is reserved for this use by the BIOS.
The total amount of RAM required is determined by an equation:
          R = xres x yres x bpp / 8,388,608
R is RAM in megabytes
xres is the x resolution in pixels
yres is the y resolution in pixels
bpp is the bit depth

All mondern video cards have at least 32MB of RAM. Modern video cards ship with large amounts of RAM to support 3D acceleration features.

          Putting it all together
Xfree86 4.x and X.org-X11 require a section that's not present in the XFree86 3.3.6 configuration file: 'serverLayout'. This section
links together all of the other components of the X configuration:
############# Server Layout Section ###############
Section "ServerLayout"
          Identifier "single head configuration"
          Screen "Screen0" 0 0

          Obtaining X display information
Sometimes, it's helpful to know about the capabilities of your display as X manages it. The tool for this job is 'xdpyinfo'. When you
type 'xdpyinfo', it produces copious information about the current display, such as the X version number, the resolution and color depth
of all the current displays, and so on.
For still more technical information, you can use the '-ext [extension]' option to 'xpdyinfo.extension' is the name of an X extension.
You can obtain detailed technical information about a specific window with the 'xwininfo' command. In basic use, you type 'xwininfo',
move the mouse cursor over a window, and click.

xwininfo option:

          Alternate Window Selection Methods:
The -id and -name options enable you to identify a window by an ID number or by its name. 
The -root option selects the root window. (entrie display)
          Window Relationships:
Like processes, windows can have parents and children. Identify these relationships with the -children option.
The -tree option works in a similar way, but it works recursively.
          Basic Information:
The -stats option is used by default. You can restrict the output by using the -bits option, which limits output to information on the
windown's bit states.
          Additional Information:
The -events option produces information on the events that the window processes
-size displays information on sizing hints
-wm displays window manager data
-frame modifies the display to include information on the window manager's frame
-metric adds measures in millimeters (mm) to the regular pixel-based measures
-english adds measures in feet and inches
-all display all available information
