          Linux, the main GUI is known as the X Window System or X for short.

Several implementations of X are available:
  XFree86 : The dominant X server in Linux until 2004 was XFree86. This open-source server supports a wide array of video cards and
input devices.  A significant changes occurred between version 3.3.6 and the 4.x series.
  X.org-X11 : Most Linux distributions shifted from XFree86 to X.org-Xll because of licensing changes to XFree86. Because X.org-X11
is based on XFree86, the two are virtually identical in most important respects. One significant difference is the name of the 
configuration file and another is the default location for fonts.
  Accelerated-X : The commercial Accelerated-X sercer from Xi Graphics is an alternative to the open-source XFree and X11. 
  


          x configuration utilities
        
The X server itself includes the capacity to query the hardware and produce a configuration file. 
To do this, type:
    XFree86 -configure      # for XFree86
    Xorg -configure         # for X11
The configuration file should be located at:
    /root/XF86Config.new    # for XFree86
    /root/xorg.config.new   # for X11
    
Many modern distributions ship with their own custom X configuration tools. 
Display Settings Tool - accessible from the default desktop menu or by typing:
    system-config-display
    	
    
    
          X configuration file format

X.org-X11
This server's configuration file is called xorg.conf and it's usually stored in /etc/X11
    (Many modern X.org-X11 configurations omit the X configuration file entirely, instead relying on runtime auto-detection of hardware.
    This often works fine, but if X doesn't work or if some of its features are set incorrectly, you may need to generate an xorg.conf
    file by typing Xorg-configure when X is not running and edit the file manually.)
