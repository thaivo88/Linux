man command is short for manual. if you want to learn more about the shell commands you would type man [command]
to quit press Q
default the manual is displayed using less pager
ues the -P option to use more pager
use the -K option if you can't remember the exact name of the command: man -k [keyword/command]
if you get no resuts from a man utility keyword search, its most likely due to a missing whatis database.
The whatis database contains a short description of each man page.
to create it or update it, type makewhatis at the prompt.
