    Setting a linux computer's time zone
Linux uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) internally. This is the time in Greenwich, England, uncorrected for daylight saving time.
When you write a file to disk on a linux native filesystem, the time stamp is stored in UTC.
(cron use UTC when running schedule jobs)
Linux are able to translate between local time and UTC, to perform this translation, Linux needs to know your time zone. Linux looks to 
the /etc/localtime file for information about local time zone. This file is the rare configuration files that's not a plain-text file,
so you shouldn't try editing it with a text editor. This file can be a file of its own or a symbolic or hard link to another file.
If it's a symbolic link, you should be able to determine your time znoe by performing a long file listing to see the name of the file
to which 'localtime' links:
  ls -l /etc/localtime
