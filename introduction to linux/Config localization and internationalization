    Setting a linux computer's time zone
Linux uses Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) internally. This is the time in Greenwich, England, uncorrected for daylight saving time.
When you write a file to disk on a linux native filesystem, the time stamp is stored in UTC.
(cron use UTC when running schedule jobs)
Linux are able to translate between local time and UTC, to perform this translation, Linux needs to know your time zone. Linux looks to 
the /etc/localtime file for information about local time zone. This file is the rare configuration files that's not a plain-text file,
so you shouldn't try editing it with a text editor. This file can be a file of its own or a symbolic or hard link to another file.
If it's a symbolic link, you should be able to determine your time znoe by performing a long file listing to see the name of the file
to which 'localtime' links:
    ls -l /etc/localtime
If /etc/localtime is a regular file and not a symbolic link, or if you want further confirmation of your time zone, try using the 
'date' command by itself. Note that the time zone codes vary depending on whether daylight saving time is active.

If you need to change your time zone, you should copy of link a sample file from a standard directory location to the /etc/localtime file:
1.  Log in as root or acquire root privileges.
2.  Change to the /etc directory
3.  View the contents of the /usr/share/zoneinfo directory. This directory contains files for certain time zones named after the zones or 
the regions to which they apply. Most users will need to look in subdirectories, such as /usr/share/zoneinfo/US for the United States or
/usr/share/zoneinfo/America for North and South America.
