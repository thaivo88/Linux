It's the 'init' program's job to start all of those programs when the linux system starts up. This is called the initialization process.
There are currently three popular initialization process methods used in linux distributions:
  1:  Unix System V (SysV)        /etc/init.d
  2:  systemd                     /usr/lib/systemd
  3:  Upstart                     /usr/share/upstart
  
The original linux 'init' program was based on the unix system V 'init' program, and it become commonly called SysV. The SysV 'init'
program uses a series of shell scripts, divided into separate runlevels, to determine what programs run at what times. Each program uses
a separate shell script to start and stop the program. The system administrator sets the runlevel in which the linux system starts, 
which in turn determines which set of programs is running.
            service - runlevel1     service - runlevel2     service - runlevel3 .....

Upstart version of the 'init' program was developed as part of the Ubuntu Linux distribution. Its main goal was to handle the dynamic
environment that hotplug devices cause in linux. Upstart method uses separate configuration files for each service, and each service
configuration file sets the runlevel in which the service should start. One service file that's used for multiple runlevels.
            service - (runlevel1-6)

The systemd program was developed by the Red Hat linux distribution to handle dynamic linux environments as well. Similar to Upstart,
it too uses separate configuration files to define program behavior.
            service - (runlevel1-6)



                              SysV
The key to the SysV initialization process is runlevels. The 'init' program determines what services to start based on the runlevel
of the system. Runlevels are numbered from 0 to 6, and each one is assigned a set of services that should be active for that runlevel.

            Runlevel Functions
Single-user mode, to get to this mode when booting linux, you use 1, S, or s, or single as an option 
passed to the kernel by the boot loader. Single-user mode is simply an available runlevel for your system.
Runlevels 0, 1, and 6 are reserved for special purpose. If you run into peculiar runlevel numbers, consult /etc/inittab
it defines them and often contains comments explaining the various runlevels.

Runlevel    Purpose
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0           A transitional runlevel; used to shift the computer from one state to another. It shuts down the system.
1,s,S       Single-user mode. Low-level system maintenance.
2           On Debian base. A full multi-user mode with X running and a graphical login. 
3           On Fedora, Mandriva, Redhat base. A full multi-user mode with a console (nongraphical) login screen. (CLI)
4           Undefined by default. Customization.
5           On Fedora, Mandriva, Redhat base. Same behavior as runlevel 3; having X run with an XDM (graphical) login
6           A transitional runlevel. Used to reboot the system.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't configure your default runlevel to 0 or 6. If you do, your system will immediately shut down or reboot once it finishes
powering up.

There are two main ways to affect what programs run when you enter a new SysV runlevel. The first is to add or delete entries
in your /etc/inittab file.

Basics of the /etc/inittab file
Each line consists of four colondelimited fields:
    [id]:[runleves]:[action]:[process]

Identification Code:  The 'id' field consists of a sequence of one to four characters that identifies its function.
Applicable Runlevels: 
Action to be Taken: 
Process to Run:
