Displaying files in Octal with od
          od (octal dump)
    od [file]
some files aren't easily displayed in ASCII (graphics, audio, and non-ASCII files); it looks gibberish!
od display files in an octal (base 8) format by default.
the first field on each line (you can look at it as like the first column) as an index, 
the remaining number on each line represent the bytes in the file.

Sorting files with sort
    sort [option] [file]
          -f or --ignore-case : ingnore case      
          -M or --month-sort : sort by three-letter month abbreviation example (JAN)
          -n or --numeric-sort : sort b number
          -r or --reverse : sorts in reverse order
          -k [field] or --key=[field] : sort by field column; to use more than one field, separated the fields by commas
                    example: sort -k 3 listing.txt
          
Breaking a file into pieces with split
     split -[option] [file] [new_output_file]
          -b [size] or --bytes=size : breaks the input file into pieces of size bytes.
                    This option can have undesirable consequence of splitting the file mid-lines.
          -C=[size] or --line-bytes=[size] : split by bytes in line-sized chunks   
          -l [lines] or --lines=[lines] : splits the file into chunks with no more than the specified number of lines.
                    example: split -l 2 listing.txt number 
                    (splitting the listing.txt by two line into a new doc called numberaa and numberab)
          *By default split output files into 1,000-line chunks with names beginning with x 
          (xaa, xab, xac.... (depending out big the file needs to be split into))*
          
Translating charaters with tr
     tr [options] [SET1] [SET2]
          tr command changes individual characters from standard input.
          SET1 : characters you want replaced in a group
          SET2 : characters you wanted them to be replaced as a second group
          (each character in set1 is replaced with the one at the equivalent position in SET2)
                    example: tr BCJ bc < listing.txt
                    listing.txt

                    (All the cap letters are translated into lower case(B into b ; C into c)
                    In SET2 there is no 3rd set in that group so will revert into the last group in SET2 = c
                    The cap letter J will turn into lower case c)
          -t or --truncate-set1 : truncate SET1 to the size of SET2 instead.
          -d : delete the characters from SET1 (with -d option you omit SET2)          
                    
Converting spaces to tabs with unexpand
      unexpand [option] [number] [file]
      converts multiple spaces to tabs which help compress the size of files that contain many spaces
          -t [number] or --tabs=[number] : which sets the tab spacng to once every [number] characters.
          If you omit this option the command defaults a tab stop every 8 characters.
          
Deleting Duplicate lines with uniq
      uniq command removes duplicate lines.
                    example: sort shakespeare.txt | uniq
                    be                                      | cat shakespeare.txt
                    is                                      | to be or not to be. that is the question
                    not                                     | be
                    or                                      | or
                    question                                | not
                    that                                    | to
                    the                                     | be.          
                    to                                      | that
                                                            | is
                                                            | the
                                                            | question
