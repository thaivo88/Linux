The touch command is the easiest way to create new, empty files. 
It is also used to change the timestamps (i.e., dates and times of the most recent access and modification) on existing files and directories.
  -last file-modification time
  -last inode change time
  -last access time

  touch's syntax is
touch [option] [filename]
    or
touch [directory path/file_name]

Sometimes you may need to modify the time stamps.
By default, 'touch' sets the modification and access times to the current time.

Options:
Change Only the Access Time:  -a or --time=[atime]
  causes touch to change the access time alone, not modification time
Change Only the Modification Time:  -m or --time=[mtime]
  causes touch to change the modification time alone, not the access time
Do Not Create File: -c or --no-create
  If you don't want touch to create any files that don't already exist
Set the Time as Specified:  -t [timestamp]
  Sets the time to the value specified by [timestamp]. This value is given in the form MMDDhhmm[[CC]YY][.ss]
  MM is month
  DD is day
  hh is hour (on 24-hour time)
  mm is minute
  [CC]YY is year (CCYY=2019 YY=19)
