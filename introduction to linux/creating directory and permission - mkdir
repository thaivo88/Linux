mkdir
#     make directory - to create a directory (folder)

#     example:

mkdir [directory name]
#     or

mkdir [directory path/directory name]
#     to create a directory in a different directory (folder)

mkdir -p [new directory path/directory name]
#     adding the -p option allows to create a new directory path that does not exist yet

mkdir -m777 [directory name]
#     -m option appows permission to be added to the directory
#     The first number is for the owner permissions, the second number is for the group permissions and the last number is for everyone else.
#     4 stands for "read",
#     2 stands for "write",
#     1 stands for "execute", and
#     0 stands for "no permission."
#    
#     the user can read, write, and execute it;
#     members of your group can read and execute it; and
#     others may only read it.
#     7 = (4: read) + (2: write) + (1: execute)
#     5 = (4: read) + (1: execute)
#     4 = (4: read)
