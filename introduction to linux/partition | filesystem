                          Partition
        Why Partition?
  Multiple-OS support: partitioning enables you to keep the data for different OSs separate.
  Filesystem Choice: By partitioning your disk, you can use different filesystems-data structures designed to hold all of the files on a partition.
  Disk Space Management: By partitioning your disk, you can lock certain sets of files into a fixed space.
  Disk Error Protection: If data structures on one partition become corrupted, the errors affect only the files on that partition.
This separation can therefore protect data on other partitions and simplify data recovery.
  Security: You can use different security-related mount options on different partitions.
  Backup: Keeping partitions small you may be able to back up more easily.
  
        Understanding Partitioning System
Partitions are defined by data structures that are written to specified parts of the hard disk. Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning
system, so called because it stores its data in the first sector of the disk. MBR is limited to partitions and partition placement of 
2 tebibytes. The successor to MBR is the GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitioning system.

        MBR Partition
Allowed for only 4 partitions
  Primary partitions: which are the same as the original partition types
  Extended partitions: which are a special type of primary partition that serve as placeholders for the next type.
  Logical partitions: which reside within an extended parttion

The primary partitions have nubers in the range of 1-4, whereas lovial partitions are numbered 5 and up.
You can backup your MBR partitions by typing:
        sfdisk -d /dev/sd[x] > sd[x]-backup.txt
You can then copy the backup file to a removable disk or another computer for safekeeping.
You can restore the backup by typing:
        sfdisk -f /dev/sd[x] < sd[x]-backup.txt
MBR partitions have type codes, which are 1-byte (two-digit hexadecimal) numbers:
  FAT:  0x0c
  ext:  0x05
  NTFS: 0x07
  swap: 0x82
  Linux file system: 0x83
  
        GPT Partition : GUID Partition Table
GPT is the preferred partitioning system for disks bigger than 2TiB. Most EFI-based computers use GPT.
GPT employs a protective MBR, which is a legal MBR definition that makes GPT-unaware utilities think that the disk holds a single MBR 
partition that spans the entire disk. Data structures are duplicated, with one copy at the start of the disk and another at the end.
This provides redundancy that can help in data recovery should an accident damage one of the two sets of data structures.
You can define up to 128 partitions by default
    *fdisk utility doesn't work with GPT disks
    **GPT does not imploy primary/extended/logical distinction of MBR
    
        LVM : logical volume management
An alternative to partitions for some functions is logical volume management LVM. To use LVM, you set aside one or more partitions and
assign them MBR partition type codes. You then use a series of utilities, such as 'pvcreate', 'vgcreate', 'lvcreate', and 'lvscan', 
to manage the partitions (known as physical volumes in this scheme), to merge them into volume groups, and create and manage logical
volume within the volume groups. You can access the logical volumes using names you assigned them in the /dev/mapper directory, such
as /dev/mapper/myvol-home. The biggest advantage to LVM is that it enables you to resize your logical volumes easily without worrying
about the positions or sizes of surrounding partitions.

        Common Partitions and Filesystem Layouts
        
Partition               Typical
Mount point             Size                        Use

Swap (not mounted)   One to two times the        -Serves as an adjunct to system RAM. It is slow but enables the computer to run
                     system RAM size             more or larger programs.
/home                200MiB-3TiB or more         -Holds users' data files. Isolating it on a separate partition preserves user data
                                                 during system upgrade. Size depends on the number of users and their data storage needs.
/boot                100-500MiB                  -Holds critical boot files. Creating it as a separate partition lets you circumvent
                                                 limitations of older BIOSs and boot loaders, which often can't boot a kernel from a
                                                 point above a value between 504MiB and 2TiB.
/usr                 500MiB-25GiB                -Holds most linux program and data files; this is sometimes the largest partition,
                                                 although /home is larger on systems with many users or if users store large data file.
                                                 Changes implemented in 2012 are making it harder to create a separate /usr partition.
/usr/local           100MiB-3GiB                 -Holds linux program and data files that are unique to this installation, particularly 
                                                 those that you compile yourself.
/opt                 100MiB-5GiB                 -
