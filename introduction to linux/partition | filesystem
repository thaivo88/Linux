                          Partition
        Why Partition?
  Multiple-OS support: partitioning enables you to keep the data for different OSs separate.
  Filesystem Choice: By partitioning your disk, you can use different filesystems-data structures designed to hold all of the files on a partition.
  Disk Space Management: By partitioning your disk, you can lock certain sets of files into a fixed space.
  Disk Error Protection: If data structures on one partition become corrupted, the errors affect only the files on that partition.
This separation can therefore protect data on other partitions and simplify data recovery.
  Security: You can use different security-related mount options on different partitions.
  Backup: Keeping partitions small you may be able to back up more easily.
  
        Understanding Partitioning System
Partitions are defined by data structures that are written to specified parts of the hard disk. Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning
system, so called because it stores its data in the first sector of the disk. MBR is limited to partitions and partition placement of 
2 tebibytes. The successor to MBR is the GUID Partition Table (GPT) partitioning system.

        MBR Partition
Allowed for only 4 partitions
  Primary partitions: which are the same as the original partition types
  Extended partitions: which are a special type of primary partition that serve as placeholders for the next type.
  Logical partitions: which reside within an extended parttion

The primary partitions have nubers in the range of 1-4, whereas lovial partitions are numbered 5 and up.
You can backup your MBR partitions by typing:
        sfdisk -d /dev/sd[x] > sd[x]-backup.txt
You can then copy the backup file to a removable disk or another computer for safekeeping.
You can restore the backup by typing:
        sfdisk -f /dev/sd[x] < sd[x]-backup.txt
MBR partitions have type codes, which are 1-byte (two-digit hexadecimal) numbers:
  FAT:  0x0c
  ext:  0x05
  NTFS: 0x07
  swap: 0x82
  Linux file system: 0x83
