Head
Viewing the start of files with head
With head command the default output is 10 lines of the first beginning of files to be printed out.
    Specify the number of bytes: tells head command to display [num] bytes
        -c [num] or --bytes=num
    Specify the number of lines: tells head command to display [num] of lines
        -n [num] or --line=[num]
        
Tail
Viewing the ends of files with tail
With tail command the default output is 10 lines of the last end of files to be printed out.
    Specify the number of bytes: tells tail command to display [num] bytes
        -c [num] or --bytes=num
    Specify the number of lines: tells tail command to display [num] of lines
        -n [num] or --line=[num]    
    Track a file: Follow; keep the file open and to display new lines as they're added.
        -f or --follow
    Stop tracking on program termination: terminate tracking once the process with a PID 
        -pid=[PID]
        
Less
more complex version of more; joking name because "less is more"
    spacebar : move forward a file a screen at a time
    ESC + V : moves backward through the file a screen at a time
    Up and Down : move up or down through the file a line at a time.
    / : search function
        n : repeat the search forward
        N : repeat the search backward
    ? : search backward
    g[number] : jump to the specific line number
    q : exit
    
Extracting text with cut
    -b [list] or --bytes=[list] : cuts the specified list of bytes from the input file.
    -c [list] or --characters=[list] : cuts the specified list of characters from the input file.
    -f [list] or --fields=[list] : cuts the specified list of fields from the input file.
    -d [char] or --delim=[char] or --delimiter=[char] : where [char] is the character you want to use to delimit fields.
    -s or --only-delimited : changes this behavior so that the program doesn't echo lines that don't contain the delimiter character.
    
Obtaining a word count with wc
wc count words, lines, and byte
    -l or --lines : count lines
    -w or --words : count words
    -c or --bytes : count bytes
    -m or --chars : count characters
