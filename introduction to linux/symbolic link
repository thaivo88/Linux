#symbolic link is like a short cut in windows
#symbolic link can also make a link of data into different file name
#ln : link
##-f Force existing destination pathnames to be removed to allow the link.
#-L For each source_file operand that names a file that is a symbolic link, create a hard link to the file referenced by the symbolic link.
#-P For each source_file operand that names a file that is a symbolic link, create a (hard) link to the symbolic link itself.
#-s Create symbolic links instead of hard links. If the -s option is specified, the -L and -P options are silently ignored.
#If more than one of the mutually-exclusive options -L and -P is specified the last option specified determines the behavior of the utility.
#If the -s option is not specified and neither a -L nor a -P option is specified, the implementation defines which of the -L and -P options will be used as the default.
  ln -s [file1] [link1]
