RPM Base Distro:
-SUSE  
-RedHat: splintered into three distributions:
  -Fedora version favored by home users, students, and business on tight budget
  -CentOS is a freely redistributable version intended for enterprise users
  -RedHat reserved for the for-pay version of the distribution

                          packagename-a.b.c-x.arch.rpm
                          
Package Name: The first component (packagename) is the name of the package.
Note: the same program may be given different package names by different distribution maintainers.

Version Number: The second component (a.b.c) is the package version number.

Build Number: The number following the version number (x) is the build number (also known as the release number).
This number represents minor changes made by the package maintainer, not by the program author.
Many distribution maintainers add a letter code to the build number to distinguish their packages from those of others.
Note: that these numbers are not comparable across package maintainers.

Architecture: The final component preceding the .rpm extenstion (arch) is the code for the package's architecture.
CPU-independent packages generally use the noarch architecture code.
The main execption to this rule is source RPMs, which use the src architecture code.
