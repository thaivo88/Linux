RPM Base Distro:
-SUSE  
-RedHat: splintered into three distributions:
  -Fedora version favored by home users, students, and business on tight budget
  -CentOS is a freely redistributable version intended for enterprise users
  -RedHat reserved for the for-pay version of the distribution

                          packagename-a.b.c-x.arch.rpm
                          
Package Name: The first component (packagename) is the name of the package.
Note: the same program may be given different package names by different distribution maintainers.

Version Number: The second component (a.b.c) is the package version number.

Build Number: The number following the version number (x) is the build number (also known as the release number).
This number represents minor changes made by the package maintainer, not by the program author.
Many distribution maintainers add a letter code to the build number to distinguish their packages from those of others.
Note: that these numbers are not comparable across package maintainers.

Architecture: The final component preceding the .rpm extenstion (arch) is the code for the package's architecture.
CPU-independent packages generally use the noarch architecture code.
The main execption to this rule is source RPMs, which use the src architecture code.

                        RPM package compatibility issues:
                        
-Distributions may be different versions of the RPM utilities.
-An RPM package designed for one distribution may have dependencies that are unmet in another distribution.
    A package may require a newer version of a library than is present on the distribution you're using.
    To overcome this problem by installing or upgrading the package dependencies, but sometimes doing so causes problems
    because the upgrade may break other packages. By rebuilding the package you want to install from a source RPM,
    you can often work around these problem, but sometimes the underlying source code also needs the upgraded libraries.
-An RPM package may be built to depend on a package of a particular name, but if the distribution you're using
    has named the package differently, the RPM utility will object. You can override this objection by using the --nodeps switch.
-Different distributions may include slightly different files in their packages. 
-Some programs include distribution-specific scripts or configuration files. This problem is particularly acute for servers,
    which may include startup scripts that go in /etc/rc.d/init.d or elsewhere. To overcome this requires you to remove
    the offending scripts after installing the RPM.
    
                      rpm [operation][options] [package-files|package-names]

RPM Operations:
-i                    installs a package
-U                    installs a new package or upgrades an existing one
-F or --freshen       upgrades a package only if an earlier version already exists
-q                    queries a package; finds whether a package is installed, what files it contains, and so on
-V or --verify        verifies a package; checks that its files are present and unchanged since installation
-e                    uninstall a package
-b                    builds a binary package, given source code and configuration files; moved to the rpmbuild program with RPM version 4.2
--rebuild             builds a binary package, given a source RPM file; moved to the rpmbuild program with RPM version 4.2
--rebuilddb           rebuilds the RPM database to fix errors

RPM options:
option                used with
--root [dir]            any           modifies the linux system having a root directory located at [dir].
--force                 i U F         forces installation of a package even when it means overwriting existing packages.
-h or --hash            i U F         displays a series of hash marks to indicate the progress of the operation
-v                      i U F         used in conjunction with the -h option to produce a uniform number of hash marks for each package
--nodeps               i U F E
