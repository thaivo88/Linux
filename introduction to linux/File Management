                          Naming Files
Its recommended that you restrict any non-alphanumeric symbols in your linux filenames to dot (.), the dash (-), and the underscore (_).
Although linux filenames can contain spaces, they must be escaped on the linux command line or enclosing the entire filename in quotes (").
      escaped command: \ the backslash
      
      Special Characters      *should never use in filename*
asterisk (*)
question mark (?)
forward slash (/)
backslash (\)
quotation mark (")

      Linux filename length:
ext2fs, ext3fs, ext4fs, xfs, btrfs    limit 255 characters/bytes
1-to-4 character filename extensions; followed by a single dot

  Filenames can begin with a dot
Files begin with a dot are hidden files that are many view by utilities that display files.
A filename consists of a single dot (.) refers to the current directory
Whereas a filename that consists of a double dot (..) refers to the parent directory. (a directory level up)


          Wildcard
You can use wildcards with many commands. A wildcard is a symbol or set of symbols that stands in for other characters.
Three classes of wildcards are common in linux:
? : A question Mark stands in for a single character.
* : An asterisk matches any character or set of character, including no character.
[]  : Bracketed match any character in the set or array of characters.
Remember linux treats filenames with case-sensitive, using bracket wildcard you must remember to use the correct case.
