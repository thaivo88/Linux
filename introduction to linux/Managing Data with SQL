The Structured Query Language SQL, is a language used for retrieving data from a database.
SQL is a language for accessing data, and specific SQL packages implement that language.

  MySQL
Oracle owns this SQL implementation
  PostgreSQL
A compressed form of post-ingres SQL. Available under the BSD license.
  SQLite
Is a library that implements SQL. It's not a stand-alone database; instead, it's intended to provide programs with a way to store data
using SQL interface within the program.

Some SQL packages, including MySQL and PostgreSQL, operate on a client-server model: one program (the server) manages the database, while
another (the client) provides users and programs with access to the database. Such implementations can work over a network, enabling users
at multiple client systems to access a centralized database server.

Understanding SQL Basics

SQL is a tool for accessing databases, and more specifically, relational database. Each row (sometimes known as a tuple) represents a
single object or other item, and each column (sometimes referred to as an attribute or field) represents a specific feature. The combination
of rows and columns is referred to as a table. Each database may contain multiple tables, and SQL supports multiple databases. To access 
data, you must first select a database and a table.

A database enables retrieval of information that matches specific criteria. You can search, insert, delete, and update information in a 
table. SQL supports multiple tables, so you can have, for example, different tables for office property and for employees who work in
your office.

Columsn (attributes) in a database hold specific types of data, and swapping them around makes little sense. The restrictions placed on
what may appear in a column are known as a domain or a data type. Mathematic operators can manipulate the numeric data types (INTERGER,
DECIMAL, and so on).

Common SQL data type
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Type Name            Purpose
INTEGER (INT)             4-byte integer value
SMALLINT                  2-byte integer value
DECIMAL                   Precision storage of decimal values
NUMERIC                   Precision storage of decimal values
FLOAT                     Floating-point number
DOUBLE PRECISION          Floating-point number stored with twice the precision of FLOAT
DATETIME                  A date and time
DATE                      A date
TIME                      A time, in HH:MM:SS format; may be a time of day or a period of time
CHAR                      One or more characters
VARCHAR                   A variable number of characters
ENUM                      An enumerated list, such as small, medium, or large
SET                       Data that may have zero or more values, as in any of the set of nuts, sprinkles, fudge, 
                          and cherry for ice cream toppings.

To begin a SQL session type 'mysql'
  mysql
To learn what's defined, you can use the SHOW DATABASES command
  SHOW DATABASES
Commands are terminated by semicolons (;)
SQL commands are conventionally shown in uppercase. However, SQL commands are case insensitive.

To create a database:
  CREATE DATABASE
Although SQL commands are case insensitive, database names are not.
To use the new created database use the use command
  USE [database_name]
Within each database, tables must be created and selected for use. The command to do so are similar to the commands used to create and
select database.
The response Empty set denotes an empty database. To fill the database with data, you must first decide on a table structure-what sort
of data you want to record.
