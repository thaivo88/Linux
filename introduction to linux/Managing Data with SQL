The Structured Query Language SQL, is a language used for retrieving data from a database.
SQL is a language for accessing data, and specific SQL packages implement that language.

  MySQL
Oracle owns this SQL implementation
  PostgreSQL
A compressed form of post-ingres SQL. Available under the BSD license.
  SQLite
Is a library that implements SQL. It's not a stand-alone database; instead, it's intended to provide programs with a way to store data
using SQL interface within the program.

Some SQL packages, including MySQL and PostgreSQL, operate on a client-server model: one program (the server) manages the database, while
another (the client) provides users and programs with access to the database. Such implementations can work over a network, enabling users
at multiple client systems to access a centralized database server.
