MUNGE
An authentication service for creating and validating credentials. It is designed to be highly scalable for use in an HPC cluster 
environment. It allows a process to authenticate the UID and GID of another local or remote process within a group of hosts having 
common users and groups. These hosts form a security realm that is defined by a shared cryptographic key. Clients within this security 
realm can create and validate credentials without the use of root privileges, reserved ports, or platform-specific methods.

NIS
The Network Information Service, or NIS, is a clientâ€“server directory service protocol for distributing system configuration data 
such as user and host names between computers on a computer network.

NFS
Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems (Sun) in 1984, 
allowing a user on a client computer to access files over a computer network much like local storage is accessed.

Lustre
Lustre is a type of parallel distributed file system, generally used for large-scale cluster computing. 
The name Lustre is a portmanteau word derived from Linux and cluster.

Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. 
It was originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

CUDA
CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by Nvidia for general computing on its own GPUs 
(graphics processing units). CUDA enables developers to speed up compute-intensive applications by harnessing the power of GPUs for the 
parallelizable part of the computation.

FPGA
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are semiconductor devices that are based around a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) 
connected via programmable interconnects. FPGAs can be reprogrammed to desired application or functionality requirements after manufacturing.

OPA
Omni-Path (also Omni-Path Architecture, abbr. OPA) was a high-performance communication architecture owned by Intel. It aims for low 
communication latency, low power consumption and a high throughput. Intel plans to develop technology based on this architecture for 
exascale computing.

IB
InfiniBand (IB) is a computer networking communications standard used in high-performance computing that features very high throughput 
and very low latency. It is used for data interconnect both among and within computers.

5 key functions in a computer system:
  1     application platform
  2     hardware moderator
  3     data storage
  4     security
  5     connectivity

Linux OS is composed of the following componets:
  -The Linux Kernel: Fullfills the key operating system
  -Libraries: Prewritten code elements that application programmers can use in their programs
  -Utilities: Wide variety of utilities to maintain the OS
  -GUI (Graphical User Interface)
  
When a computer start up it loads a small code called the bootloader.
The bootloader's job is to load the Kernel and get it started than transfer control.
  Power on PC > Bootloader Code > Linux Kernel > Linux OS
  
Bash - A command-line interface
gcc - A C++ compiler (GNU C Compiler)

Software developed under GNU is referred to as free software
A variation on free software concept is called open source software

GPL (GNU General Public Licence)

Before deploying a Linux Distro you need to conduct a Need Assessment
A Need Assessment is a process of determining why the deployment is being undertaken, what outcomes are expected, and when it is expected to be completed.
  -What are the goals of the deployment?
  -Who are the stakeholders?
  -When is the system needed?
  
Afer gathering your Need Assessment you can define your installiation plan:
  -The project scope
  -What to do
  -When to do it
  -Who will do it
  
HCL (Hardware Compatibility list)

Linux OS roles:
  -Using Linux on the Desktop
  -Using Linux on the Server
  -Embedding Linux in Firmware
  -Using Linux for Virtualization
  -Using Linux with Cloud Computing
  
Linux can assume a variety of server roles:
  -File Server: NFS (Network File System) or Samba Services.
      -Config to provide network storage of user's files
      -NFS is great for Linux & Unix
      -Samba is for Window Client system
      -Using Samba on a Linux can be config as a functional window domain controller.
  -Print Server: Using Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) and Samba Services together
      -Linux can be config to provide shared printing for network users.
  -Database Server: Config as a powerful database server
  -Web Server
  -E-Mail Server
  -Virtualization: A pool of multiple OS instance onto the same physical hardware and allows them to run concurrently.
      -Uses a Mediator called a Hypervisor to manage access to system resources.
      -Each OS instence is installed into a virtual machine instead of onto a phyiscal hardware.

Different type of source of commands:
  -Commands built-in to the shell itself
  -Commands that are stored in files that are searched by the shell
  -Aliases: using aliases to shortcut a command
  -Function
  
  When the current task has run a sufficient amount of time, the CPU pause the task so that another may run. This is called Pre-emptive Multitasking.
    -Pre-emptive Multitasking means that the kernel is deciding when to switch focus between task.
    
  Boot Menu is managed by the GRUB or GRUB2 bootloader; on older distro use the LILO bootloader.
    config boot menu display: 
        /etc/grub.conf
        /etc/grub/menu.lst
        
 Linux are config to boot into a graphical environment called runlevel5
    Runlevel3 : text base environment CLI
    Runlevel5 : Graphical environment GUi
        To switch environment use the command:
            init[runlevel_number]
            example: init 3
            switches from GUI to CLI
  
  Command to shut system down
      init 0 : switch the system to runlevel0 ; which halts the system
      init 6 : switch to runlevel6 ; reboot the system
      halt : shutdown the system
      reboot : reboot the system
      shutdown : shutdown the system
          shutdown +m -h|-r message
            +m option specifies the amount of time (in minutes) before shutting down or replace it with a time hh:mm
            -h|-r option = halt | reboot
            example: shutdown 12:00 -r please save all work, system shut down at noon
            shutdown -c (cancel shutdown)
      
 Runlevel = init
      init 0 = runlevel0 : halts
      init 1 = runlevel1 : single-user mode (mode for administrative task)
      init 2 = runlevel2 : multi-user mode (does not config network interface and does not export networks services)
      init 3 = runlevel3 : text base environment CLI
      init 4 = runlevel4 : not used/user-definable (for special purpose)
      init 5 = runlevel5 : graphical environemnt GUI
      init 6 = runlevel6 : reboot

Linux GUI is modular: its composed of several different pieces that work together.
    -X Server : is the component that draws windows graphically on the display. It also is responsible for managing your mouse and keyboard.
        2 Different X Server:
            -X.org-X11 : default used by modern linux distro.
            -XFree86 : up until 2004 was the default X Server but licensing issue drive Linux commiunity to adopt X.org-X11.
                X Window : client
                X Server : server
                  Config file:
                      /etc/X11/xorg.conf
                      /etc/X11/XF86Config
    -Window Manager : While X Server creates window within the GUI, Window Manager's job is to customize how the window look and behave.
        Different Window Managers:
            -TWM (Tab Window Manager) [basic]
            -WMaker (Window Maker) [basic]
            -FVWM (F virtual Window Manager) [basic]
            -Enlightenment (GNOME desktop environment) [complex]
            -KWIN (KDE) [complex]
            -Sawfish (GNOME) [complex]
   -Desktop Environment : (modular) leverages the look and feel, created by the Window Manager and adds a series of tools and utilities. 
     (Desktop Environment is optional but recommended)
        -Different Desktop Environments:
            -KDE
            -GNOME
