5 key functions in a computer system:
  1     application platform
  2     hardware moderator
  3     data storage
  4     security
  5     connectivity

Linux OS is composed of the following componets:
  -The Linux Kernel: Fullfills the key operating system
  -Libraries: Prewritten code elements that application programmers can use in their programs
  -Utilities: Wide variety of utilities to maintain the OS
  -GUI (Graphical User Interface)
  
When a computer start up it loads a small code called the bootloader.
The bootloader's job is to load the Kernel and get it started than transfer control.
  Power on PC > Bootloader Code > Linux Kernel > Linux OS
  
Bash - A command-line interface
gcc - A C++ compiler (GNU C Compiler)

Software developed under GNU is referred to as free software
A variation on free software concept is called open source software

GPL (GNU General Public Licence)

Before deploying a Linux Distro you need to conduct a Need Assessment
A Need Assessment is a process of determining why the deployment is being undertaken, what outcomes are expected, and when it is expected to be completed.
  -What are the goals of the deployment?
  -Who are the stakeholders?
  -When is the system needed?
  
Afer gathering your Need Assessment you can define your installiation plan:
  -The project scope
  -What to do
  -When to do it
  -Who will do it

Linux OS roles:
  -Using Linux on the Desktop
  -Using Linux on the Server
  -Embedding Linux in Firmware
  -Using Linux for Virtualization
  -Using Linux with Cloud Computing
  
Linux can assume a variety of server roles:
  -File Server: NFS (Network File System) or Samba Services.
      -Config to provide network storage of user's files
      -NFS is great for Linux & Unix
      -Samba is for Window Client system
      -Using Samba on a Linux can be config as a functional window domain controller.
  -Print Server: Using Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) and Samba Services together
      -Linux can be config to provide shared printing for network users.
  -Database Server: Config as a powerful database server
  -Web Server
  -E-Mail Server
  -Virtualization: A pool of multiple OS instance onto the same physical hardware and allows them to run concurrently.
      -Uses a Mediator called a Hypervisor to manage access to system resources.
      -Each OS instence is installed into a virtual machine instead of onto a phyiscal hardware.

Different type of source of commands:
  -Commands built-in to the shell itself
  -Commands that are stored in files that are searched by the shell
  -Aliases: using aliases to shortcut a command
  -Function
  
  When the current task has run a sufficient amount of time, the CPU pause the task so that another may run. This is called Pre-emptive Multitasking.
    -Pre-emptive Multitasking means that the kernel is deciding when to switch focus between task.
