Text-mode user environments are controlled through shell configuration files. For bash, these may include the following files:
/etc/profile
Files in the /etc/profile.d directory
/etc/bash.bashrc
/etc/bashrc
~/.bashrc
~/.bash_profile
~/.bash_login
~/.profile

The files in /etc are global configuration files, which affect all users. The configuration files located in users' home directories
affect individual users' accounts and can be customized by individual users.

You can also see all of your current environment variables by using the env, printenv, or set command.

When using useradd command, useradd copies files from the skeleton directory (/etc/skel by default) into a newly created home directory.
The skeleton directory is the blueprint to create new user's home directory, most of the files are the hidden files with the dot in
front of the file name.

Changes you make to the skeleton directory files won't automatically be moved into existing users' directories. The file change will
affect only new users. This fact makes the global files (such as /etc/profile) preferable to /etc/skel files for any changes to system
defaults that you want to implement system-wide.
