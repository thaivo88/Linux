Regular expressions are similar in principle to the wildcard; tools for describing or matching patterns in text.
  Two forms of regular expression are common:
    1: basic
    2: extended
  Simplest type of regular expression is an alphabetic string. 
  These regular expressions match any string of the same size or longer that contains the reular express.
    -Bracket Expression:
      Characters enclosed in square brackets [] constitute bracket expressions, which match any one character within the brackets.
        example: b[aeiou]g        match the words: bag, beg, big, bog, and bug
    -Range Expression:
      Range expression is a variant of a bracket expression. Instead of listing every character that matches,
      range expression list the start and end points separated by a dash -
        example: a[2-4]z          match: a2z, a3z, and a4z
    -Any Single Character:
      The dot . represents any single character execpt a newline.
        example: a.z              match: a[0-9 or a-z]z
    -Start and End of Line
